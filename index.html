               <h3>Colorado Springs</h3>
               <p>
                  After an incredibly long drive, me and my girlfriend made our first stop in Colorado
                  Springs to see the Garden of the Gods. We only stayed briefly since we had 4 more to Telluride where 
                  we would begin hiking Mt.Sneffels first thing in the morning.

               <h3>Beginning of Climb</h3>
               <p>
                  We had only been hiking for about a mile and views along the way were really amazing. Lush forest 
                  and fresh water streams, we made sure to bring Purification tablets so we didn't end up with diarrhea
                  overnight incase anything upstream was contaminating the water.

               <h3>San Juan Mountains</h3>
               <p>
                  This was about 3.5 miles up. We had climbed roughly 2,500ft maybe and we were exhausted. My girlfriend 
                  didn't have experience hiking so I began carrying her pack along with mine early on in the hike. My legs 
                  very weak and I needed some food, but we were so close so we had to continue along to get to the campground
                  where we could finally rest for the night.

               <h3>Almost There...</h3>
               <p>
                  Finally we broke the treeline. The entire time up this hike we kept asking hikers on the descent how long we had to go and 
                  if the path ever got any easier. They all gave us encouragement and said it would get easier but we were 4.5 miles up at this point
                  and it was a straight uphill climb the entire way.

               <h3>Blue Lakes of Mt.Sneffels</h3>
               <p>
                  This is what we came to see. It's even better in person. This is the first of three lakes on the mountain. 
                  Me and my girlfriend were both exhausted so we set up camp here and enjoyed some amazing views overnight. I planned
                  the trip out for June so that the Milky-Way would be visible in the night sky. 10/10 would recommend.
